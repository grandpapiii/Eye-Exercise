# Eye-Exercise
A pair of eyes that will move along with your mouse.
In this assignment, we were taskewd with creating a second eye that would follow the movement of our mouse on the webpage from the center of the browser.

# Road of future improvements
In the future, I would like to learn how to have each eye individually follow the mouse's absolute position on the web page to make the eyes go cross eyes. Each eye would indivually follow the cursor not based on a start point of the center of the page.
